Question #, Answers (ABCDE), Explanation
1,B,"The expression creates an iterable IEnumerable which groups the strings by their length. The count() method returns the number of different elements in that iterable."
2,D,"This behaves the same as Q1. The lambda expression s => s, does nothing, meaning Select() has no effect in this case."
3,A,"Select() returns list of groups, whereas SelectMany() returns each element inside each of those lists."

32,C,"See Assignment 2."
33,E,"See 03 HTTP.pdf (page 13), all request headers are optional in HTTP 1.0."
34,D,"p shift 7 = x."
35,C,"The script runs before the browser has rendered the body, so the document.querySelector() call returns nothing."
36,A,"Both X, Y are valid JSON objects. Z is a valid JSON value, but not a valid JSON object. See http://www.json.org/."
37,A,"XOR operations are commutative and associative, thus if X and Y are true, Z is too. X and Y are true; this can be quickly proved using a truth-table."
38,A,"Common distances between repeated letter groups = {'hwd': 20, 'sexl': 44, 'alo': 28}. These share 4 as a common divisor, making it the most likely key length."
39,A,"Kasiski analysis is the name for the technique used in Q38. Frequency analysis is needed to crack the cypher once its length is discovered. See 215_Cryptography.pdf (slides 18-32)."
40,D,"See /docs/OKP.txt."
41,C,"Both X and Y are required for cryptographic hash functions. Z is not."
42,B,"The question should be read as 'what are desired qualities of a web application with integrity', source, 30th October revision session."
43,A,"MACs provide integrity, Digital Signatures provide authentication, Encryption provides confidentiality."
44,D,"See '02 Revision215.pdf' (slide 23)"
45,B,"The passwords are too difficult to crack which eliminates X and Z"
46,A,"The implication is that if both client and server use the same keys, each host will be unable to distinguish its own messages from the other's."
47,E,"TLS uses MAC-then-Encrypt, meaning that the integrity of the plaintext is provided (but not cyphertext). TLS uses digital signatures to certify public key ownership, thus authenticity is also provided."
48,E,"See https://pthree.org/2011/04/06/convert-text-to-base-64-by-hand/ for detailed instructions"
49,B,"All three have to be trusted, to some extent, in order to access the internet. Source: 30th October revision session."
50,A,"W = CSRF (w/ malicious code), X = XSS (w/ relatively harmless code), Y = SQLi, Z = HTML injection. In order of severity, SQLi > CSRF > XSS > HTML injection."
51,E,"Removing and escaping characters are both reasonable methods of avoiding SQLi attacks. Replacing characters with another random character is unreliable."
52,C,"SQLCommand is a .NET class used to parameterise SQL queries. See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand(v=vs.110).aspx"
53,C,"X, Y, Z are all potential security threats that may arise from an otherwise 'trusted' principal."

55,B,"See '04 Web Security.pdf' (slide 62)."
56,B,"See '04 Web Security.pdf' (slide 72)."
57,C,"The uri and username are both sent by the client response. The password hash is sent indirectly via the response field. See '04 Web Security.pdf' (slide 74)."
58,B,"Autenticated users may be compromised or inadvertently provide malicious data (See Q53). Reversing and re-reversing data does not achieve anything useful."
59,B,"XSS involves decieving the client, not the server. CSRF involves leading the server to believe that the client request is legitimate."
60,D,"In this threat model a network user can send packets but not modify, drop, duplicate, nor intercept other packets. Source: 30th October revision session."
